Local property owners and developers can list their vacancies and open waiting lists with Eden I&amp;R for free.&nbsp; There are three solid advantages to listing vacancies with Eden I&amp;R, 1. Additional Exposure: Last year 211 Alameda County received approximately 50,000 calls from community members seeking housing.&nbsp; 2. Saves Property Owners Time: Only callers who meet the owner’s general guidelines are referred. &nbsp;3. Saves Property Owners Money: The housing referral service is free to property owners and community members. To list a property call 510-727-9565, email housing@edenir.org. or fill out online form at www.edenir.org or www.achousingchoices.org.<br /><br />Agencies: Housing Subscriptions are intended for community-based organizations and other direct service providers seeking a comprehensive source of affordable housing information for their clients. A one-year subscription includes 24 installments (biweekly) of the PDF document and/or the hard copy of all the housing listings in our database for an annual fee. Fees are on a sliding scale based on the size of the agency, refer to www.edenir.org for subscription fees.<br /><br />211 callers in need of housing: Eden I&amp;R manages a database of over 87,000 housing units mostly located throughout Alameda County. Eden I&amp;R lists affordable properties managed and developed by local &nbsp;housing authorities, affordable developers and landlords to add vacancies and open waiting lists to the housing database. Although the priority is affordable housing, Eden I&amp;R lists: 1. Property owners that work with rental subsidy programs and 2. Property owners that offer fair market rate rentals. By simply calling 2-1-1 the public can access these vacancies and waiting lists 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The housing listings can also be accessed on Eden I&amp;R’s housing website, www.achousingchoices.org.<br />&nbsp;","Open to all.","38904749","38898599","38904749","info@edenir.org","Property Owners: No Fee for listing of housing vacancies.

They receive outreach services, full pampering services, food, and transportation. Throughout the event participants have access to vital outreach and community services from organizations, healthcare providers, local businesses, government agencies, churches, social groups, and schools. Guests receive valuable information and resources that address housing, mental health and recovery, legal services, job opportunities and training, healthcare, education, and youth services. Children are included in the experience with their own space to shop free for toys, games, and books.
