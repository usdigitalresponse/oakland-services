Local property owners and developers can list their vacancies and open waiting lists with Eden I&amp;R for free.&nbsp; There are three solid advantages to listing vacancies with Eden I&amp;R, 1. Additional Exposure: Last year 211 Alameda County received approximately 50,000 calls from community members seeking housing.&nbsp; 2. Saves Property Owners Time: Only callers who meet the owner\u2019s general guidelines are referred. &nbsp;3. Saves Property Owners Money: The housing referral service is free to property owners and community members. To list a property call 510-727-9565, email housing@edenir.org. or fill out online form at www.edenir.org or www.achousingchoices.org.<br /><br />Agencies: Housing Subscriptions are intended for community-based organizations and other direct service providers seeking a comprehensive source of affordable housing information for their clients. A one-year subscription includes 24 installments (biweekly) of the PDF document and/or the hard copy of all the housing listings in our database for an annual fee. Fees are on a sliding scale based on the size of the agency, refer to www.edenir.org for subscription fees.<br /><br />211 callers in need of housing: Eden I&amp;R manages a database of over 87,000 housing units mostly located throughout Alameda County. Eden I&amp;R lists affordable properties managed and developed by local &nbsp;housing authorities, affordable developers and landlords to add vacancies and open waiting lists to the housing database. Although the priority is affordable housing, Eden I&amp;R lists: 1. Property owners that work with rental subsidy programs and 2. Property owners that offer fair market rate rentals. By simply calling 2-1-1 the public can access these vacancies and waiting lists 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The housing listings can also be accessed on Eden I&amp;R\u2019s housing website, www.achousingchoices.org.<br />&nbsp;",

Posted: 4-13-2020 3:29pm SMR</span><br /><br />Property Owners: In our effort to assist community members in securing housing Eden I&amp;R maintains a housing database to provide 2-1-1 callers with vacancies or open waiting lists. Local property owners and developers can list their vacancies and open waiting lists with Eden I&amp;R for free.&nbsp; There are three solid advantages to listing vacancies with Eden I&amp;R, 1. Additional Exposure: Last year 211 Alameda County received approximately 50,000 calls from community members seeking housing.&nbsp; 2. Saves Property Owners Time: Only callers who meet the owner\u2019s general guidelines are referred. &nbsp;3. Saves Property Owners Money: The housing referral service is free to property owners and community members. To list a property call 510-727-9565, email housing@edenir.org. or fill out online form at www.edenir.org or www.achousingchoices.org.<br /><br />Agencies: Housing Subscriptions are intended for community-based organizations and other direct service providers seeking a comprehensive source of affordable housing information for their clients. A one-year subscription includes 24 installments (biweekly) of the PDF document and/or the hard copy of all the housing listings in our database for an annual fee. Fees are on a sliding scale based on the size of the agency, refer to www.edenir.org for subscription fees.<br /><br />211 callers in need of housing: Eden I&amp;R manages a database of over 87,000 housing units mostly located throughout Alameda County. Eden I&amp;R lists affordable properties managed and developed by local &nbsp;housing authorities, affordable developers and landlords to add vacancies and open waiting lists to the housing database. Although the priority is affordable housing, Eden I&amp;R lists: 1. Property owners that work with rental subsidy programs and 2. Property owners that offer fair market rate rentals. By simply calling 2-1-1 the public can access these vacancies and waiting lists 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The housing listings can also be accessed on Eden I&amp;R\u2019s housing website, www.achousingchoices.org.<br />&nbsp;",
